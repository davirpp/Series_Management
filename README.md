# Series Management Program
This programs works simply manipulating .xlsx files that was created by the user to manage his serie's progress 
* The 2 .xlsx files are examples of the 'shape' for the files that the user will use

## How to use it
* Once you create a folder and put the [main.py](https://github.com/davirpp/Series_Management/blob/master/main.py) and
[treatment.py](https://github.com/davirpp/Series_Management/blob/master/treatment.py), you can choose if you want to keep all these files together (including the .xlsx files)
or create a folder to the .xlsx files;
* Go to treatment.py and modify the paths to the correct ones based on your machine;
* Then, run the main.py and follow the simple menu 

 #### **NOTE: You can see on the last function from [treatment.py](https://github.com/davirpp/Series_Management/blob/master/treatment.py), that I chose to use match case, which is available only on Python 3.10, so to avoid this limitation, below is commented an alternative way to do the same thing!**
